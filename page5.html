                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5"></p><p>Turner travelled quite extensively throughout his career. From the Swiss Alps to the Rhine to Paris, he traversed a lot of ground in his time, almost always with a sketchbook in hand. Britain’s hostilities with France, and then the outbreak of the French Revolution, precluded travel to the continent for much of his early life. This caused Turner, as it caused other British artists, to turn inward and begin to explore their country in a way they had not done so before. Up until this point, British art and culture had held up Continental art and artists as the ideal. Turner travelled and sketched throughout around London and later the rest of the British Isle as a young man in the late 18th century.<br><br>The end of the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon afforded an opening up of the continent once again (for a period at least) to British artists. The signing of the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 temporarily ceased hostilities between Britain and France. British artists flooded into Paris. Although Turner did make his way to Paris in 1802, he initially passed through the city fairly quickly. He had his sights set on the Swiss Alps. They constituted uncharted territory for British artists and he could barely contain his enthusiasm witness their majesty with his own eyes, as well as to paint them for his countrymen to see. On the return leg of his return journey he did make a longer stop in Paris. It was at this time that he availed himself of the opportunity take in the artistic bounty on offer at the Louvre for the first time. <br><br><br></p><p></p>

After the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo Turner made his next trip to the continent to tour the battlefield at Waterloo and explore the Rhine.<br><br>It was his next trip the following year, however, that would mark a turning point in his career. He would visit Italy for the first time. Explore the Story Map below to follow his path on his first trip this historic Mediterannean landscape.&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Although he would later become better known for capturing the dreamy atmosphere and light of Venice, at the time of his first trip to Italy in 1819 he had his sights firmly set on Rome. It was Rome after all that was the heart of classical art; it was the finale of the Grand Tour; and it was the place where his artistic idol Claude Lorrain had worked much of his career, two centuries earlier.<br><br>On this first trip Turner spent the bulk of his time in Rome. While there, he worked at a steady clip producing a large number of sketches. He would make quick pencil sketches in the open air, he said, as this allowed him to make perhaps 15 times as than he could if he were to make color sketches. He would hold the details and colors of the scene in memory and finish the color sketches and watercolors in his lodgings in the evening.<br><br></p><p></p><p><br><br></p><p></p>

It took up a large part of his ‘cognitive map’. He had given little thought to Venice, and it was little more than an afterthought when he decided to stop off there for a few days before journeying on to The Eternal City. Moving forward, however, Rome would become less a focus of his work. He would certainly continue to returning to classical themes from time to time throughout the rest of his career. It would also, though, mark a transition in his work, as his focus began to shift.<br><br>During the latter years of his career it was Venice, rather than Rome, that would become a more frequent theme of his work. Although the sum total of time he spent in Venice in his life amounted to not more than a month, it would come to take up an outsized place thoughts and in his work. Venice would come to loom large in his mind. The way he began to think about and represent light began to evolve during his career. Perhaps the shimmering, diffuse light of Venice helped him shift his perspective.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
